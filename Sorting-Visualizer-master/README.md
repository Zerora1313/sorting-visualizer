🔍 What I'm Working On – Sorting Visualizer Project
I'm building a Sorting Visualizer using ReactJS to help visualize how different sorting algorithms work.

💡 Why This Project?
Understanding algorithms becomes easier when we see them in action. This tool visually shows how elements are sorted using animations.

🧩 Main Features:
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort visualized step-by-step

Interactive UI with:

Start & Reset buttons

Adjustable speed and array size using sliders

Animated vertical bars to show sorting progress

⚙️ How It Works (Simple Terms):
During sorting, we keep track of which elements are being compared and swapped.

These actions are stored in an animations array.

Then we use that data to change the color and height of bars, using setTimeout() to create smooth visual effects.

🎯 Goal:
Make sorting algorithms fun, interactive, and easy to understand — great for learning or teaching.
